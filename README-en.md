Currently only Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) and English (en-US) are supported. If you are interested in translating to other languages, please fork the code and create your language file in Assets/Files/Lang and write it according to the zh-CN.xaml standard.

By default, we will read your computer's primary language and set it as the default display language for the program.
